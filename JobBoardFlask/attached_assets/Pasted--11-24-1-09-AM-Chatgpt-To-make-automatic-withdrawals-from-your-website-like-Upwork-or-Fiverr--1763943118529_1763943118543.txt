[11/24, 1:09 AM] Chatgpt: To make *automatic withdrawals* from your website (like Upwork or Fiverr), you'll need to set up a *secure payment integration* with a payout system.

---

✅ How Automatic Withdrawals Work:

1. *Freelancer earns money*
2. *Balance is stored* in their account on your site
3. On withdrawal (manual or scheduled), your system:
   - Validates user + balance
   - Sends payout request to payment API (e.g. PayPal, Payoneer, Flutterwave)
   - Updates status in your database

---

🔧 Tools You Can Use:

| Payout Method     | API/Service              | Regions     |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| *PayPal Payouts* | PayPal REST API          | Global      |
| *Payoneer API*  | Payoneer Partner Program | Global      |
| *Stripe Connect*| For US/UK-based apps     | Selected    |
| *Flutterwave*   | For Africa (Nigeria etc.)| Africa      |
| *Wise API*      | Cross-border payouts     | Global      |

---

🛠️ Steps to Set It Up:

1. *Add a "Withdraw" button* in user dashboard
2. When clicked (or on schedule):
   - Check if user balance ≥ withdrawal amount
   - Get user’s payout info (e.g. PayPal email)
   - Send a *POST request* to the payout API
   - On success, deduct balance + save transaction

---

🧱 Example (PayPal Payouts - Python):
```python
import requests
[11/24, 1:09 AM] Chatgpt: def send_paypal_payout(receiver_email, amount):
    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'}
    data = {
        "sender_batch_header": {
            "email_subject": "You got a payment"
        },
        "items": [{
            "recipient_type": "EMAIL",
            "amount": {"value": amount, "currency": "USD"},
            "receiver": receiver_email,
            "note": "Thanks for your work"
        }]
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api-m.paypal.com/v1/payments/payouts', json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()
```

---

⚠️ Important:
- You must *verify users’ payout info*
- Log every transaction for audits
- Use *SSL* and strong security for all APIs
